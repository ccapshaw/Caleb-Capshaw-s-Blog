<h1>Introduction</h1>
<body>
<p>Almost five years ago I made a decision that would significantly change my life forever. I decided to go back to school and make a career change. It sounds simple. Conceptually, it is simple. But for many individuals, like myself, it is a difficult decision. To let go of all the hard work and effort you've put into a career. To let go of all the years of education and study. I believe that most people directly correlate a large amount of their identity with their job. We take pride in our work, which reflexively causes us to take pride in ourselves. However, there are times when a change has to be made. Sometimes this is because the work just doesn't suit us.  Sometimes this is because external circumstances force us to change. But change isn't always bad.</p>
<p>The purpose of this initial blog post is to share the story of my own career change. To share the challenges that I faced that had to be overcome. Hopefully this initial post is encouraging to those who may find themselves in a similar positions, regardless of their current field. The purpose of this blog after this initial post will be for my to share knowledge and insights into my continuous education for the benefit of others. I hope that if you're someone who is considering a career change or are in the middle of one, you will find this post encouraging.</p>

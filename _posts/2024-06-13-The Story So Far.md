<h1>Introduction</h1>
<body>
<p>Almost five years ago I made a decision that would significantly change my life forever. I decided to go back to school and make a career change. It sounds simple. Conceptually, it is simple. But for many individuals, like myself, it is a difficult decision. To let go of all the hard work and effort you've put into a career. To let go of all the years of education and study. I believe that most people directly correlate a large amount of their identity with their job. We take pride in our work, which reflexively causes us to take pride in ourselves. However, there are times when a change has to be made. Sometimes this is because the work just doesn't suit us.  Sometimes this is because external circumstances force us to change. But change isn't always bad.</p>
<p>The purpose of this initial blog post is to share the story of my own career change. To share the challenges that I faced that had to be overcome. Hopefully this initial post is encouraging to those who may find themselves in a similar positions, regardless of their current field. The purpose of this blog after this initial post will be for my to share knowledge and insights into my continuous education for the benefit of others. I hope that if you're someone who is considering a career change or are in the middle of one, you will find this post encouraging.</p>

<h1>How I became a PTA</h1>
<body>
  <p>For the majority of my teenage years, my plan was to always work with computers. However during my senior year of highschool, I found a new passion for exercising. This led to me going into college at Freed-Hardeman University in 2010 in pursuit of a degree in exercise science so that I could one day become a physical therapist. Like many 18-22 year olds, I didn't really do my homework about the profession or what it took to get into a physical therapy program after completing my bachelors. When my senior year rolled around, I came to the realization that I did not have the appropriate classes that were required for most doctorate of physical therapy programs. My only choice was to take an incredibly difficult year of classes (which quite frankly, I would've done pretty poorly with) or find something else to do with my degree. Because of this, I made the decision to go into a physical therapist assistant (PTA) program instead. It would be two years, instead of three, and also would be significantly cheaper.</p>
<p>In 2014, I began my PTA program at Chattanooga State Community College. It was a tough two years. My fiancee (now wife) was living with her parents 10 hours away, because we didn't want to get married until we had a stable income. My school was 45 minutes away from my house. My classes started extremely early in the morning because I was commuting from CST to EST every morning. The classes were intense. There was constant tests and quizzes. Lab practicals with instant fail condition that still make me nervous to think about. Despite the difficulty, I was able to pass and find a job.</p>

<h1>Life as a PTA</h1>
<body>
  <p>Starting my first PTA job was a real eye opener. Despite the amount of education that I had just went through, I quickly learned there was much more to learn. Luckily, I was in a great place with great people to learn from. I did everything I could to learn and improve my skillset and knowledge. There weren't many options for continuing education for PTAs, but I pursued what I could. I earned the Advance Proficiency Pathway for Orthopedics from the American Physical Therapy Association within the first 2 years that I worked as a PTA. I enjoyed the altruistic and serving nature of the job. I loved patients who truly wanted to get better that allowed me to facilitate their recovery. But the longer I worked, the more issues I started to have.</p>
  <p>Burnout is a popular topic in most professions. I'm not sure that I've ever seen an article about a profession where people don't burnout. Being a PTA was burning me out. The nature of the job was exhausting for me. I think a large part of that was probably due to my introverted nature, but the job itself was taxing. I mentioned previously that I loved exercising. I found it more difficult to exercise in the three and a half years I was a PTA than any other time in my life. I was also frustrated by the fact that my PTA license was holding me back. I like to be ambitious and always be working towards something. However, I got to the point where it felt like there was nothing to work for. The combination of having no direction and burnout made me frequently ask myself the question "Am I really going to be able to do this for another 40 years?"</p>

<h1>The Decision</h1>
<body>
  <p>In July of 2019, I was eating lunch in the breakroom at work and my boss sat down beside me. He told me some news that spiked my blood pressure and made me nauseous. He told me that changes were coming that would reduce PTA reimbursement rates for Medicare and there was a good chance that other insurances would follow suit. After some additional discussion, I came to the conclusion that my job may soon be in jeopardy. When I said earlier that we often tie our identity to our career, this is when I felt that the most. I had to make a decision. Continue to ride a ship that I wasn't enjoying riding or let go of all the work I had put in over the past 9 years.</p>
  <p>I remember around this time my wife and I had been watching the show Chuck. If you've never seen it, it's a show about a nerdy guy who gets a super computer full of government secrets in his head. I loved it and it made me miss all the fun stuff I used to do with my computer when I was in highschool. So when I thought about a career change I knew it needed to be something with computers. One of the challenges of going back to school is figuring out how to pay the bills while you do it. I knew I needed to be able to continue working while going back to school. I began researching programs and was able to find an IT program to get a bachelor's degree that was reasonably priced, only 18 months with my previous credits, and assignments were given on a weekly basis. I remember coming home from work the day I found the program and telling my wife that we needed to talk. I told her that I felt that I wanted and needed to go back to school. She was immediately supportive of my decision and we started the paperwork to get me enrolled in the August 2019 program.</p>
